I have been attacking machine-learning (ML) models well before adversarial examples 
were even discovered, in the context of cybersecurity-related applications like spam filtering, malware detection, web security, and biometric recognition ([PRJ 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03141)). 
Our team has been the first to formalize attacks on ML models as optimization problems, and
demonstrate gradient-based evasion ([ECML-PKDD 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06131)) and poisoning ([ICML 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.6389)) attacks on machine-learning algorithms, playing a leading role in the establishment and advancement of this 
research field.

I am a research co-director at sAIferLab, leading research efforts in AI Security.
