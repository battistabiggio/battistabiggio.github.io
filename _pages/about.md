**Short biography.** Battista Biggio received the MSc degree 
in Electronic Engineering, with honors, and the PhD in Electronic 
Engineering and Computer Science, respectively in 2006 and 2010, 
from the University of Cagliari (Italy). 
Since 2007 he has been working for the Department of Electrical 
and Electronic Engineering of the same University, 
where he currently is an Assistant Professor. 
From May 12th, 2011 to November 12th, 2011, 
he visited the University of Tuebingen (Germany), 
and worked on the security of machine learning algorithms 
to contamination of training data.

**Research interests.** His research interests currently include:

- secure / robust machine learning (adversarial machine learning);
- multiple classifier systems; and
- kernel methods;

with applications in biometric recognition, 
spam filtering, malware detection, 
and intrusion detection in computer networks.

**Italian National Scientific Qualification.** Dr. Biggio obtained 
the Italian National Scientific Qualification for the role of 
Full Professor in Computer Engineering on July 30, 2020, 
and of Full Professor in Computer Science on April 29, 2021; 
and for the role of Associate Professor in Computer Engineering 
on April 04, 2017, and of Associate Professor in Computer Science 
on April 10, 2017.
 
**Reviewer activity / memberships.** Dr. Biggio serves as a reviewer 
for several international conferences and journals, 
including Pattern Recognition and Pattern Recognition Letters. 
He is a Senior Member of the IEEE Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (Computer Society, and Systems, Man, and 
Cybernetics Society), and of the Italian Group of Italian 
Researchers in Pattern Recognition (GIRPR/CVPL), 
affiliated to the International Association for Pattern Recognition. 
Since January 2017, he has been nominated chair of the 
IAPR Technical Committee 1 on Statistical Pattern Recognition 
Techniques. He is Associate Editor of Elsevier Pattern Recognition, 
IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 
and the IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine.
 
He has co-chaired and organized DLS (2020, 2019), 
AISec (2019, 2018, 2017), and S+SSPR (2020, 2018, 2016). 
He has also served as PC member for several conferences, 
including (but not limited to):
- ICLR 2022, 2021;
- CVPR 2020;
- AAAI 2020, 2019;
- WACV 2022;
- IEEE Symp. on Security and Privacy 2022, 2021, 2020;
- USENIX Sec. 2022, 2021, 2020;
- ACM CCS 2022;
- IJCAI 2020, 2019, 2018;
- NeurIPS 2022, 2021 (top reviewer), 2020, 2019;
- ICML 2021, 2020, 2019;
- ESANN 2019;
- ICPR 2022 (Area Chair), 2018 (Area Chair).
