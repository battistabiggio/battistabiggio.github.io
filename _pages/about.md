**Short biography.** Battista Biggio received the MSc degree 
in Electronic Engineering, with honors, and the PhD in Electronic 
Engineering and Computer Science, respectively in 2006 and 2010, 
from the University of Cagliari (Italy). 
Since 2007 he has been working for the Department of Electrical 
and Electronic Engineering of the same University, 
where he currently is an Assistant Professor. 
From May 12th, 2011 to November 12th, 2011, 
he visited the University of Tuebingen (Germany), 
and worked on the security of machine learning algorithms 
to contamination of training data.

**Research interests.** Battista Biggioâ€™s research over the past 15 years has addressed theoretical and methodological issues in the area of machine learning and pattern recognition, in the context of real-world applications, including spam filtering, intrusion and malware detection, and biometric recognition. He has provided pioneering contributions in the area of adversarial machine learning, demonstrating gradient-based evasion and poisoning attacks on machine-learning algorithms, and how to mitigate them, playing a leading role in the establishment and advancement of this research field.

**Awards**
- 2022 ICML Test of Time Award for the paper: "Poisoning Attacks against Support Vector Machines" (published at ICML 2012).
- 2021 Best Paper Award and Pattern Recognition Medal for the paper: "Wild Patterns: Ten Years After the Rise of Adversarial Machine Learning" (published on Elsevier Pattern Recognition in 2018).
- 2014 Premium Award for Best Paper in IET Biometrics journal: "Security Evaluation of Biometric Authentication Systems under Real Spoofing Attacks" (published on IET Biometrics in 2012).

**Italian National Scientific Qualification.** Dr. Biggio obtained 
the Italian National Scientific Qualification for the role of 
Full Professor in Computer Engineering on July 30, 2020, 
and of Full Professor in Computer Science on April 29, 2021; 
and for the role of Associate Professor in Computer Engineering 
on April 04, 2017, and of Associate Professor in Computer Science 
on April 10, 2017.
 
**Reviewer activity / memberships.** Dr. Biggio serves as a reviewer 
for several international conferences and journals, 
including Pattern Recognition and Pattern Recognition Letters. 
He is a Senior Member of the IEEE Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (Computer Society, and Systems, Man, and 
Cybernetics Society), and of the Italian Group of Italian 
Researchers in Pattern Recognition (GIRPR/CVPL), 
affiliated to the International Association for Pattern Recognition. 
He was chair of the 
IAPR Technical Committee 1 on Statistical Pattern Recognition 
Techniques (2017-2020), and Associate Editor of
IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 
IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, and Int'l Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics.
He is currently Associate Editor of the Elsevier Pattern Recognition journal.
 
He has co-chaired and organized DLS (2020, 2019), 
AISec (2019, 2018, 2017), and S+SSPR (2020, 2018, 2016). 
He has also served as PC member for several conferences,
