Battista Biggioâ€™s research over the past 15 years has addressed theoretical and methodological issues in the area of machine learning and pattern recognition, in the context of real-world applications, including spam filtering, intrusion and malware detection, and biometric recognition. He has provided pioneering contributions in the area of adversarial machine learning, demonstrating gradient-based evasion and poisoning attacks on machine-learning algorithms, and how to mitigate them, playing a leading role in the establishment and advancement of this research field.
